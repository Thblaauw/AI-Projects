To run the program, just run the makefile and it will compile everything
you can also run the regular way g++ Source.cpp/ g++ Node.cpp and so on\

This programs is trying to solve the 3x3 puzzle of a board like this: 0 1 2
                                                                      3 4 5
                                                                      6 7 8 
The 0 is the "empty spot" in the board and therefore allows the pieces to move into it from adjectns positions.
